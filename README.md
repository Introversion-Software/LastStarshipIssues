# Last Starship Issue Tracker

Welcome to The Last Starship Issue Tracker

## Help us prioritise bugs!

If you've found a bug and want to report it, the first thing you should do is click on the Issues button on the banner. Then, look for the search bar next to the filters and see if someone else has already reported the same bug. If they have, you can give it a thumbs up reaction to show that you've experienced it too.

## How to report a bug

If you don't find the bug you're looking for, you can click on the "New Issue" button and select "Get started" next to the "Bug Report" option. Fill out the form with as many details as possible, including how you came across the bug and what you were doing at the time. This will help us fix the problem faster.

Thank you for your help!
